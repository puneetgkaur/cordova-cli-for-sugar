# Apache Cordova Hello World Application

Simple Hello World application. This is used as the default app template
when creating new projects.

## Versions and Tags

The Hello World's version is directly tied to an Apache Cordova release.

For example, Hello World `2.0.0` is compatible with Apache Cordova `2.0.0`.

To update the snapshot within a platform repo, copy `www/` into the repo's
template directory, and copy in the relevant files from `res/` as well.
